    <h5 id="heax" style="text-align: center"> why no ebook reader or smartphone?</h5>
    <p style="width=100px; text-align: center">
        E-Book readers and smartphones allow us to access almost all books worldwide in no time. You can
        ususally trial read and swipe from one to another to best practice the
        trial and error strategy I described
        on my <a href="/strategie.html">strategy</a> page. They are often
        small and need relative few space. But can you sit on  them e.g. when you carry
        them in your wallet pocket of your trousers?
        Can you carry them without hassle in your front pocket?  No and there we go.
        My strategy is made for the small area of your trousers and jackets which should
        not bulge and it should be light in the hand and work without energy.

        There is no distraction (especially important with smartphones) and a large
        content pool larger than electronic readers. Not all books have
        been transferred to digital. This pool via "used bookstores" and peddlarsmarkets
        can be accessed for a small price.

        I also like the look and feel of paper and books. Their often phantastic covers
        and the fact that if I store them I see what I own. That s why many people like to own
        and show off bookshelfs. You see something. With ebookreaders you see just an
        electronic device. No covers no bookshelf to show as a background in video calls.
        Disappointing. And in the end if I junk the read pages I see progress. We love to see things stored
        and filling up. Thats human and thats why I love my reading method. My bookshelf fills up
        and when I read and junk the pages it gets empty and can be filled up again. A great feeling of
        satisfaction. The progress I see whan junking bags full of pages, emptying my bookshelf and filling
        it up again. Great.

        One practical aspect not to be neglected when travelling is: safety.
        My paperbooks are absolutely safe of theft even in the most dangerous environment
        and can be relatively easily replaced.
